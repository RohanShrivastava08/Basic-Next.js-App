## 📘 Introduction
- This project showcases the integration of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to build a fast, scalable, and highly customizable web application.
- The goal is to demonstrate how to set up and deploy a modern web app with a focus on performance and developer experience.

## ✨ Features
⚙️ Next.js Framework: Server-side rendering and static site generation out-of-the-box.

🎨 Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework to rapidly build custom designs without writing much CSS.

🔒 TypeScript: Type-safe development, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

🚀 Deployed on Vercel: Easily scalable and fast deployment with continuous integration and preview environments.

💻 Responsive Design: Mobile-first design approach using Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠 Project Implementation Process

### 1. Project Setup

#### 1.1 Initialize the Project

- Set up the Next.js project using create-next-app.
- Install Tailwind CSS and configure it with PostCSS.
- Integrate TypeScript for static typing.

#### 1.2 Version Control
- Initialize a Git repository and push the code to GitHub.

### 2. Frontend Development

#### 2.1 Tailwind CSS Integration
- Configure Tailwind CSS with Next.js by adding the necessary PostCSS and autoprefixer configurations.

#### 2.2 TypeScript Integration
- Convert the project into TypeScript and ensure all components are type-safe.

#### 2.3 Create Components
